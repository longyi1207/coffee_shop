# Coffee Shop Full Stack
This is a Cafe Menu App, where public uses can view the digital menu to order, Cafe staffs can view recipe to make the drinks, and Cafe mananger can edit and create drink recipes. Please see the screenshots below for the recipes' beautiful and clever presentations.
This is a full stack project containing both the frontend and backend sides, skeleton provided by the 
udacity full stack nanodegree project Course 4.
The technology I use include Angular, Ionic, Flask, postgreSQL, Auth0, and Postman. The above mentioned different levels of permissions for public users, cafe staff, and managers are implemented using a third-party authentication and authorization tool - Auth0.

# How to Run the App
The frontend and backend codes reside in the two subdirectories. Instructions of running them are provided in both subdirectories, in the README files. Please first run the backend server and then the frontend website.

# How to Test
A collection of API tests is included in the backend folders. Use it by simply importing it into the postman test collection and running it, while the server is running.
